# EmpyrionDlls

## What is this?

This folder temporarily stored the dlls that are bundled with Empyrion, but used by mods.

## It's empty, and that seems like a problem

At a minimum, the folder should include
* ModApi.dll
* Mif.dll

if those aren't here, you should run the BuildAssistant Script that is bundled with this package
